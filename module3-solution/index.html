                        <p>Panzanella or panmolle is a Tuscan chopped salad of soaked stale
                            bread, onions and tomatoes that is popular in the summer. It often includes cucumbers,
                            sometimes basil and is dressed with olive oil and vinegar. It is also popular in other parts
                            of central Italy. Panzanella was based on onions, not tomatoes, until the 20th century.
                            Modern panzanella is generally made of stale bread soaked in water and squeezed dry, red
                            onions, tomatoes, olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Cucumbers and basil are often added.
                            Other ingredients - lettuce, olives, mozzarella, white wine, capers, anchovies, celery,
                            carrots, red wine, tuna, parsley, boiled eggs, mint, bell peppers, lemon juice, and
                            garlic - are sometimes used, but Florentine traditionalists disapprove of them.</p>

                        <p>Bruschetta is an antipasto (starter dish) from Italy consisting of grilled bread rubbed with
                            garlic and topped with olive oil and salt. Variations may include toppings of tomato,
                            vegetables, beans, cured meat, or cheese. A popular dish is bruschetta with tomatoes; one
                            recipe popular outside Italy involves basil, fresh tomato, garlic and onion or mozzarella.
                            Bruschetta is usually served as a snack or appetizer. In some countries, the prepared
                            topping is marketed as bruschetta. In Italy, bruschetta is often prepared using a brustolina
                            grill. In the Abruzzo region of Italy a variation of bruschetta made with a salame called
                            ventricina is served. Raw pork products and spices encased in pig bladder are aged and the
                            paste spread on open slices of bread which are sometimes grilled. The dish was developed as
                            a way of salvaging bread that was going stale.</p>

                        <p>Focaccia is a flat oven-baked Italian bread similar in style and texture to pizza; in some
                            places, it is called "pizza bianca". Focaccia can be served as a side dish or as sandwich
                            bread. Focaccia has countless variations along the Ligurian coast, from the biscuit-hard
                            focaccia secca to the corn-flour, oily, soft Voltri version, some bearing little resemblance
                            to the Genoese version.An extreme example is focaccia col formaggio 'focaccia with cheese',
                            also called focaccia di Recco or focaccia tipo Recco, which is made in Recco, near Genoa.
                            This version has stracchino cheese sandwiched between two layers of paper-thin dough. In
                            Genoa, focaccia is eaten in the morning at breakfast or during the day. It is often dipped
                            in milk or in cappuccino at breakfast and eaten warm and wet.</p>
